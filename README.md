# Litres-Parser
Hi there, it's a simple Parser. It's based on library "BeautifulSoup".

Its algorithm:
1. Gets access to the code of the web resource and loads it.
2. Reads, receives and processes data.
3. Transforms the data to csv format for Excel to read it.

You can test it or use it to practice your parsing skills.

The problem I faced with was the cyrillic encoding which made it difficult to read the document.
Problem solved by choosing UTF-8 encoding.
